This IG gathers some simplified examples of FHIR profiles for testing certain general aspects of FHIR implementation.  
The profiles are not complete, and are not representing actual services. The aim of the profiles is to be as closed/constrained as possible, with an exception of extensions which are allowed, but should be ignored by the receiver unless explicitly defined in the IG.  

The IG is not for implementation.
